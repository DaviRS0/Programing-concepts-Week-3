This is an project that required the following options.

Program Requirements
Create a C# console program that presents the user with a main menu of three options using a do loop approach. Each
menu option will perform a series of calculations, as noted in the instructions below. Encapsulate the logic of Option 1
and Option 2 within their own method. 


Option 1 - Display a list of 10 sequential numbers that have their values manipulated as noted below.
1. Ask the user for the starting number.
2. Using a for loop, start with the number after the number entered and perform the following calculations to the
next 10 sequential numbers. Display the results of each calculation to the user.
a. If the number is even, multiply it by 3.
b. If the number is odd, multiply it by 2.

Option 2 - Present the user with an arithmetic problem, (e.g., What is 3 + 8?), ask for the answer, and check it.
1. This option should be created using a while loop.
2. The integer numbers for the arithmetic problem should be generated randomly.
3. Keep presenting a question to the user until they get it right. Then give them a success message.
4. After the correct answer is entered ask the user if they would like another question. Give them another question
if the user enters "Yes". If the user enters "No" return to the main menu.

Option 3 â€“ The third options is to exit the program.
